## Usage

### Pre-installed

Ghostty includes a built-in theme for Vague from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
so you can skip the first step. However, you may still want to use the [vague](vague) file from this repository.
This version is likely more up-to-date and feature-rich, since it isn't constrained by the upstream process
of generating universal theme files for multiple applications.

1. In your Ghostty configuration file, set the theme as follows:

   ```conf
   theme = Vague
   ```

### Manual

1. Save [vague](vague) file in the `themes/` subdirectory of your Ghostty configuration directory.

2. In your Ghostty configuration file, set the theme as follows:

   ```conf
   theme = vague
   ```
